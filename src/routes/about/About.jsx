              <span>01&#8250;</span> My name is Sharif Hafizi. I am 25 years old
              and have lived in Norway since June 2021. I have lived in the USA
              following programming knowledge for a period of time before I
              moved to Norway. <br /> <span>02&#8250;</span> Right now I am
              attending Kodehode, a 1 year frontend developer course. I love
              problem solving and finding logical solutions.. When I was a child
              I always tried to fix my PC myself and then I became interested in
              learning more about computers and software, especially writing
              code. I find a lot of satisfaction and motivation in writing code
              and seeing it work as intended. Coding and working as a developer
              is very much something I can see myself doing professionally. Iâ€™m
              a firm believer in finding happiness through a job I love, and I
              feel that working as a software or web developer is the kind of
              field that actually inspires me to do so. <br />{" "}
              <span>03&#8250;</span> I also like to be active, social and
              healthy. I go to the gym almost every day and play volleyball in
              my spare time. Also doing brain exercise with writing code .
